# CORDIC-Sine-Cosine-Generator
Designed and implemented a high-performance CORDIC-based sine and cosine generator using SystemVerilog, specifically optimized for resource-constrained hardware environments. By leveraging a multi-stage pipelined architecture and fixed-point arithmetic, the design achieves high-throughput trigonometric computations using only bit-shifts and additions, eliminating the need for costly multipliers or large look-up tables. To ensure industry-standard reliability, the IP core was verified using a comprehensive UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) framework. This included the development of a constrained-random testbench, functional coverage monitors, and a Python-based golden reference model to validate numerical precision across all four quadrants.
